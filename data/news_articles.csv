michael snyder realize headline must sound extremely bizarre article explain could actually happen learned fbi obtained search warrant enable agency examine approximately emails sitting electronic devices owned huma abedin estranged husband anthony weiner fbi going emails unlikely still possible decision whether charge hillary clinton crime could made november th course likely scenario hillary clinton indicted election day americans voting scandal hanging ominously clinton campaign fbi quickly take action possible hillary clinton could forced race election day would require democrats come new candidate fact already calls mainstream media clinton willingly remove race example following comes chicago tribune article entitled democrats ask clinton step aside democrats ruling democrats hold high moral standards impose people govern would follow simple process would demand mrs clinton step immediately let vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine virginia stand place democrats say honestly new criminal investigation going events around homebrew email server time secretary state clinton anywhere near white house good idea author article understand tim kaine would automatically take place clinton steps election previous article included quote us news world report article explained would happen hillary clinton removed democratic ticket reason prior november th clinton fall ticket democratic national committee members would gather vote replacement dnc members acted superdelegates years primary overwhelmingly backed clinton boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders vermont dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says currently committee members number changes time guided groups bylaws give membership specific officeholders party leaders hold spots selection states along optional slots dnc members choose fill party rules replacing presidential nominee merely specify majority members must present special meeting called committee chairman meeting would follow procedures set dnc rules bylaws committee proxy voting would allowed email scandal forced hillary clinton exit race last minute majority members democratic national committee would gather select new nominee would choose lets take look top five options tim kaine would seem obvious choice since hillary clintons running mate win national campaign need name recognition americans outside state virginia little familiarity point proven little popularity campaign trail fact attendance many rallies key swing states measured dozens seems unlikely dnc would select kaine replacement nominee joe biden vicepresident joe biden far name recognition tim kaine recent days touting believes would actually nomination would decided run vice president joe biden said recent interview believed could beat former secretary state hillary clinton democratic presidential nomination pursued biden asked interview cnn saturday news fbi reopening criminal probe clintons use private email server secretary state made secondguess decision last year run according vice president short answer thing kept running biden said recent death son beau unfortunately biden suffers many things kaine biden boring good campaign trail doesnt sort charisma would motivate people go polls large numbers biden would probably represent safest choice democrats might winning choice bernie sanders bernie sanders would seem logical choice since runnerup hillary clinton truth lot things working bernie sanders first real loyalty democrats previously operated independent expressed desire return independent status campaign secondly democratic establishment much dislikes plays huge role decisions thirdly democratic insiders fear would another mcgovern would get absolutely wiped general election even though popular radical left appears sanders would least likely choice list elizabeth warren elizabeth warren would popular bernie sanders wing party would enable party replace hillary clinton another woman definitely possibility lack name recognition like sanders would concern republicans would frame candidacy another mcgovern far left policies michelle obama one recent survey found percent democrats would rather third term obama first term hillary clinton days barack obamas approval rating running anywhere thought another obama white house farfetched might think michelle obama better name recognition anyone else list generally wellliked american people received tremendous amount praise work campaign trail recently instance recent speech new hampshire lauded influential speech campaign recent msn article entitled campaign michelle obama became another political voice speech amplified timing met enthusiastic response cemented obamas place star presidential race put defining stroke women view trump also voice moral authority three months leaving white house already among ranks public figures transcend politics title rise level like see much weight words carry said anita mcbride former chief staff laura bush executive residence school public affairs american university know didnt like politics impassioned language used feels compelled speak people listen democrats michelle obama one would select replacement nominee needed would give best chance winning donald trump course obamas radical bernie sanders elizabeth warren american people become quite comfortable point certainly hope michelle obama become nominee hillary clinton step aside donald trump would exceedingly difficult time defeating final analysis none probably going matter anyway unlikely fbi move quickly enough force hillary

multiple voting individuals one massive threat far gone completely unmentioned vulnerability electoral college postelection shenanigans people aware constitution president elected november tuesday first monday november designated congressional elections happens years states decided electors electoral college selected voters day early days republic actually common state legislatures select

bare majority democrat electors would elected notice say trump would get electoral votes used hearing fact electoral votes cast december guarantee every single one republican electors would actually vote trump remember months ago alarmed prospect supposed trump delegates republican national convention deserting trump voting cruz trump piled large victories final primaries big enough majority delegates cause never trump people republican establishment give rigging convention electors method electing electors left states method nominating candidates electoral college also left states states allow presidential candidates nominate slate electors presumably people could counted loyal states partys slate electors chosen state party conventions even electoral district conventions young man attended one convention name put nomination democratic elector three contenders made short speeches convention three talked precinct captains hardworking party volunteers gave speech calling direct election president abolition electoral college got huge round applause would easily matter principle withdrew name nomination point story electors unknown public typically cogs party apparatus even necessarily highlevel ones may even smoothtalking slicksters like unknown party likely one republican electors would betray trump person known faithless elector faithless electors never ultimately altered outcome presidential election faithless electors history fact faithless electors caused congress decide election vice president true half states laws punishing faithless voters states votes faithless electors would still count nightmare situation would close election hillary people never trump people could bribe pressure republican electors may like trump anyway vote trump could vote hillary could vote pence could vote anyone else could even abstain voting happens enough republican electors cajoled voting hillary scenario would require two hillary gets inaugurated january tie house representatives breaks tie obviously republican members house say wont vote trump president november reason assume would vote january however republicans likely retain significant majority house voting president house one vote representative one vote per state means california currently democratic representatives would get one vote alaskas single representative republican would also get one vote heavily favors republicans means hillary cannot flip enough republican electors win majority electoral votes finished real prospect house representative electing hillary enough republican electors vote people paul ryan example candidate gets majority house representatives gets choose top three vote finishers electoral college vote could get coalition democrats republican defectors would deny trump presidency give someone like ryan applies case mormon excia operative nevertrump independent presidential candidate evan mcmullen wins utah polls predict possible none scenarios may
